# 🏋️‍♂️ Project5K — Fitness Accountability Discord Bot

**Project5K** is a Python-based Discord bot that helps users stay consistent with their fitness goals by:

- Logging workout minutes via slash commands (`/log`)
- Tracking daily streaks automatically
- Sending motivational messages generated by a local **TinyLlama** LLM (fast, runs on Apple Silicon/CPU)
- Storing logs in Firebase Firestore for persistence
- Allowing users to ask any question or get motivation via `/ask`

This project runs fully **locally**, with no external LLM API dependency, and is ideal for communities who value privacy and ownership.

---

## 🚀 Features

- `/log <minutes>` – Log your daily workout (with autocomplete for common durations)
- `/ask <prompt>` – Ask the local LLM for motivation, tips, or any question (with autocomplete for example prompts)
- 💬 Local TinyLlama LLM generates personalized motivation and answers
- 🔥 7-day streak tracking with automatic DM alerts
- 🧠 Firebase Firestore storage for logs
- 🧩 Easily extendable with leaderboards, summaries, and OpenAI fallback
